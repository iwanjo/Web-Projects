# Web-Projects

This is a collection of web applications and websites I have built over the course of my journey as an aspiring designer and software developer. Access each folder and find a detailed explanation of each project.

To Access More info about the COVID-19 Live Tracker, go to the src folder which has a majority of the React Code.

Pleasure to have you!
