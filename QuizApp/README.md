Based off of a course on Udemy, I was able to use fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build a quiz application. This application will be able to load questions from a 3rd party API, track and display high scores, and more! I learnt how to use Local Storage, create animations and use modern ES6 JavaScript.
