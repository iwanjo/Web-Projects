#Welcome to AfricaExplored!

This is my personal web application project I made. The purpose of this project was to show the beauty of Africa, rather than the negativity that is often portrayed in the media. I wanted to reassure the users of the site, that no matter what Africa is growing, and her beauty is remarkable. 

In this project I utilised HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Framework and JavaScript.
