#Welcome to AfricaExplored

>This is my personal web application project I made. The purpose of this project was to show the beauty of Africa, rather than the negativity that is often portrayed in the media. I wanted to reassure the users of the site, that no matter what Africa is growing, and her beauty is remarkable. 

In this project I utilised HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Framework and JavaScript.

Below you will find the website landing page. Its hallmark are the Maasai undertones in the picture, with the background of the tranquil African Savannah and the Maasai warriors embracing the land.
